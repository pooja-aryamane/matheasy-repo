MathEasy - A Handwritten Equation Recognizer 
A graphical user interface that provides step by step solutions to handwritten equations. 
Implements a Convolutional Neural Network model within the GUI framework and uses the Wolfram Equation solver API to calibrate equation results and display steps to the user.

# How to use the code: 
GUI1.py -- GUI that includes a custom trained CNN model to recognise handwriting in GUI frame and makes API request to Wolfram for step by step solutions.  

GUI2.py -- GUI that includes a secondary pane for speech recognition using the Google Speech AI. 

Combination of GUI.py -- Create a final GUI importing GUI1 and GUI2 files
